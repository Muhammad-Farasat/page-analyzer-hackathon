Page Analyzer is a Chrome extension that allows you to analyze and interact with the content of any webpage using Groq AI. You can summarize the content or ask anything related to the current page directly from your browser — no extra setup required.

- 💬 Ask contextual questions based on the current page
- ⚙️ Backend built with Node.js + Express and already deployed
- 🌐 No terminal or command-line setup needed — just add the extension

## 💡 How It Works

Page Analyzer uses Groq AI to fetch intelligent responses about the current web page you're viewing. It sends the visible content of the page to the backend, which then processes it with Groq AI and returns a smart response.
